Tokyo Ghoul Animation Frames Setup

For the loading animation to work properly, you'll need to create sprite sheets for the animations.
Each sprite sheet should be a horizontally arranged sequence of frames from Tokyo Ghoul scenes.

Required Files:
--------------

1. kaneki-transform-strip.png
   - Width: 3200px (10 frames of 320px each)
   - Height: 180px
   - Content: Kaneki's transformation sequence from human to ghoul

2. kagune-emergence-strip.png
   - Width: 3200px (10 frames of 320px each)
   - Height: 180px
   - Content: Sequence showing kagune emerging from a character's back

3. eyepatch-strip.png
   - Width: 2880px (9 frames of 320px each)
   - Height: 180px
   - Content: Sequence showing Kaneki with his eyepatch/mask

4. crack-overlay.png
   - Width: At least 1920px
   - Height: At least 1080px
   - Content: Black and red cracks pattern to overlay in ghoul mode
   - Should be semi-transparent (PNG with transparency)

How to Create These Files:
-------------------------
1. Find high-quality clips from Tokyo Ghoul anime
2. Extract frames from key scenes (use video editing software)
3. Resize each frame to 320px width while maintaining aspect ratio
4. Arrange frames horizontally in sequence using image editing software
5. Save as PNG with transparent background if possible

- Kaneki's torture sequence with Jason
- Rize's kagune appearance
